# Updates for Lab 4

- 2 interactive faetures using JS: a font selector and a theme selector.

- You can find a settings button on the top right of the screen, and when clicking it it would have a dropdown menu of font selector and theme selector, respectively. 

- For the font selector, the default value is sans-serif, and the other option is serif; for the theme selector, we have three options: light(default, white background), dark(gray background), and high contrast(black background with yellow text).

- You can use the combination of Tab, Space, Arrow Keys, and Enter to control the whole website and the new features, including the dropdown menu.

- All elements selected will be boxed.
